portage软件包管理系统学习笔记
=============================

.. contents::

根据emerge和equery手册以及gentoo官方文档整理出的一份笔记。

疑难问题
========

安装软件包时如果遇到问题，有个优先选择的解决方案：

1. 运行revdep-rebuild修复系统先，或者升级整个系统
#. 将当前软件的版本mask，安装低版本的
#. 将错误提示中设计到的软件或者软件包重新安装
#. 有时是由于某些正在安装软件的USE引起的，可以禁用某些特定的USE

软件包管理
==========

安装软件
--------

- 安装软件包

  ::

    emerge foo

- 假装安装软件包(``--pretend`` 或 ``-p``)，可以用来查看安装信息，比如依赖和USE等等

  ::

    emerge -p foo

- 只下载不安装软件包(``--fetchonly`` 或 ``-f``)

  ::

    emerge -f foo

卸载软件
--------

emerge在卸载软件包时，会卸载安装的所有文件，除了用户修改过的配置文件。

当卸载一个被其他软件包依赖的软件包时，emerge不会给出警告。只有卸载那些重要的软件包时才会警告。

- 卸载软件包(``--unmarge`` 或 ``-C``)

  ::

    emerge -C foo

- 卸载不被依赖的软件包(``--depclean`` 或 ``-c``)

  ::

    emerge -c

- 卸载孤立依赖的软件包

  1. 用emerge -DNauv更新整个系统

  #. 用emerge -c移除孤立的软件包

  #. 用revdep-rebuild重建依赖关系

更新系统
--------

更新portage树

  ::

    emerge --sync

更新整个系统

    ::

      emerge -DNuva world

        -D --deep 代表升级world中的软件包及其依赖的所有软件包，否则不会升级被world的软件包所依赖的软件包

        -N --newuse 代表用新的USE，在修改了USE的设置后使用

        -u --update

        -v --verbose

        -a --ask

    注意这样升级仍然不包括一些在软件编译、安装过程中所依赖的软件包，使用 ``--with-bdeps=y`` 选项可以包括这些。

验证软件包的完整性
------------------

检查软件包foo的完整性(其中的k代表check)

::

  equery k foo

软件包的依赖关系
----------------

直接依赖于foo的所有软件包(其中的d代表depends)

::

  equery d foo

直接或间接依赖于foo的软件包(g代表depgraph)

::

  equery g foo

查询软件包(普通查询)
--------------------

根据名称查询软件包(``--search``)

::

  emerge -s foo

正则表达式查询(前面加%)

::

  emerge -s '%^emacs'

将软件所属类别名称也归入查询范围，需要加个'%@'。

::

  emerge -s '%@app.*emacs$'

会查询以app开 头以emacs结尾的软件包，例如app-editors/emacs。

在软件包描述中查询软件(``--searchdesc``)

::

  emerge -S foo

查询已安装的某个文件属于哪个包(belong)

::

  equery b /bin/cat

查询某个包所安装的文件及其位置(file)

::

  equery f foo

查询软件包(高级查询)
--------------------

利用 equery list [options] PKG 这种命令格式，使用一些额外的 选项来执行软件包的高级查询。

注意在不使用-f选项时需要全部匹配，例如equery list 'emacs'只 会匹配名称
为emacs的软件包，而不是名称包括emacs的所有软件包。而如 果使用了-f选项则
不需要全部匹配，例如下例中即不需要用equery list -f 'emacs'则会匹配名称
包含emacs的所有软件包。

常用选项

-d, --duplicates
List only packages with more than one version installed.

-f, --full-regex
The supplied query is a regular expression.

-m, --mask-reason
Print the reason why a package was masked.

-I, --exclude-installed
Exclude installed packages from being output.

-o, --overlay-tree
Include package from overlays in the search path.

-p, --portage-tree
Include all packages from the Portage tree in the search path. Use this option to search through all standard Gentoo packages, including those that are not installed.

查询系统中安装的所有软件包

::

  ~# equery l '*'

查询系统中安装的两个及以上不同版本的软件包(duplicates)

::

  ~# equery l -d '*'

查询名称为'emacs'的软件包

::

  ~# equery l 'emacs'
  * Searching for emacs ...
  [IP-] [  ] app-editors/emacs-23.3-r1:23


查询名称中包含'emacs'的软件包(这里的"名称"不包括软件包 所属的类别名称)

::

  ~# equery l '*emacs*'
     * Searching for *emacs* ...
  [IP-] [  ] app-admin/eselect-emacs-1.13:0
  [IP-] [  ] app-editors/emacs-23.3-r1:23

  [IP-] [  ] app-emacs/emacs-w3m-1.4.437_pre20110310:0
  [IP-] [  ] virtual/emacs-23:0

用正则表达式查询(也在软件包所属的类别名称里搜索)

::

  ~# equery l -f 'emacs'
     * Searching for emacs ...
  [IP-] [  ] app-admin/eselect-emacs-1.13:0

在整个portage树里搜索(-p)，包括没有安装的软件包

看看有那些管理工具

::

  ~# equery l -fp 'app-admin'

同上，不包括没有安装的软件包(-I)

看看有那些管理工具没有安装

::

  ~# equery l -fIp 'app-admin'

许可证
------

portage允许按照许可证来安装软件，全局设置由变量 ACCEPT_LICENSE 控制。单独的软件包可以设置在 /etc/portage/packages.license 文件中。

如果许可证前面包括'@'则说明这是一个许可证集合。

::

  ACCEPT_LICENSE="* -@EULA"

  默认值，表示除了 End User License Agreements 之外的所有许可证。

::

  ACCEPT_LICENSE="-* @FREE"

  表示只接受FREE许可证的软件，具体包括哪些许可证，可以查看 /usr/portage/profiles/license_groups 文件。

::

  ACCEPT_LICENSE="*"

  接受所有许可证。

USE设置
=======

USE概述
-------

- 全局USE列表 /usr/portage/profiles/use.desc

- 局部USE列表 /usr/portage/profiles/use.local.desc

局部USE列表文件中包含了很长的软件包名单，以及每个软件包特定的USE标记

USE使用优先级(从低到高)

1. make.defaults中的USE设定

#. /etc/portage/make.conf中的USE设定

#. /etc/protage/package.use中的USE设定

#. USE环境变量

查看和操作USE标记
-----------------

查看全局USE的最终设定值

::

  emerge --info

查看某软件包使用的USE值

::

  equery uses foo

使用euse查看USE标记，euse是一个专门查看和设置USE的工具。

查看当前激活的USE标记

::

  euse -a

查看当前激活的全局USE标记

::

  euse -a -g

查看当前激活的局部USE标记

::

  euse -a -l

Portage特色功能
===============

通过设置 FEATURES 变量来启用或者禁用某些功能，这是一个空格分割的变量，禁用某项功能时，在其前面加 ``-`` 即可。默认值如下：

::

  FEATURES="assume-digests binpkg-logs config-protect-if-modified distlocks ebuild-locks fixlafiles merge-sync news parallel-fetch protect-owned sandbox sfperms strict unknown-features-warn unmerge-logs unmerge-orphans userfetch"

列举一些常用的：

- distcc

  这个功能允许在网络上的其他机子同时进行编译，加速软件的编译过程。

- parallel-fetch

  并行下载，就是在安装多个软件时，安装编译某个软件的同时会在后台下载其它的软件

- ccache

  多次编译同一个软件时会减少编译时间。启用后需要安装 ccache ，并且在 make.conf 中设置：

  ::

    CCACHE_SIZE="2G"
    CCACHE_DIR="/var/tmp/ccache"

  注意：目前 ccache 存在某些已知问题，所以不推荐启用。

make.conf
=========

配置文件
--------

  0. 环境变量
  1. /etc/portage/make.conf
  2. /etc/make.conf
  3. /usr/share/portage/config/make.globals
  4. /usr/portage/profiles/*/make.defaults

1、2是用户配置文件，3、4是默认配置文件。另外4中的 ``*`` 表示用户的profile，即 ``eselect profile list`` 列出的值。

优先级0>1>2>3>4，即如果都定义了相同的变量，优先级高的文件中的变量会覆盖优先级低的。有三个特殊变量被称为“递归变量”，即 ``USE`` 、 ``CONFIG_PROTECT`` 和 ``ACCEPT_KEYWORDS`` ，他们的值不会简单由更高优先级文件中的定义所覆盖，如果需要彻底清除，需要使用类似于 ``USE='-*'`` 的形式。

可用变量
--------

- ACCEPT_CHOSTS = [space delimited list of CHOST values]

    Specifies acceptable  CHOST values.  Regular expression
    syntax is supported, so it is necessary to escape CHOST
    characters  if they  have  special  meaning in  regular
    expressions.
    Defaults to the value of $CHOST.

- ACCEPT_KEYWORDS

  启用测试分支，例如将其设置为 ``~x86`` 会启用x86架构的测试分支。默认值是 ``$ARCH`` 。

- ACCEPT_LICENSE

  可接受的许可证。默认值是 ``* -@EULA`` 。

  ::

    ACCEPT_LICENSE="*"                  # 接受所有许可证
    ACCEPT_LICENSE="* -public-domain"   # 接受所有许可证，除了public-domain
    ACCEPT_LICENSE="-* @FSF-APPROVED"   # 只接受FSF-APPROVED许可证组

.. ACCEPT_PROPERTIES = [space delimited list of properties]
..  This  variable  is  used  to  mask  packages  based  on
..  PROPERTIES  restrictions.   In   addition  to  property
..  names,  the   *  and   -*  wildcard  tokens   are  also
..  supported. This variable  can be temporarily overridden
..  using the --accept-properties option of emerge(1).  See
..  ebuild(5) for more information about PROPERTIES.
..  Defaults to the value of *.
..  Examples:
..  # Accept any properties
..  ACCEPT_PROPERTIES="*"
..  # Accept any properties except the "interactive" property
..  ACCEPT_PROPERTIES="* -interactive"

.. CBUILD
..  This variable  is passed by  the ebuild scripts  to the
..  configure as  --build=${CBUILD} only if it  is defined.
..  Do not set  this yourself unless you know  what you are
..  doing.

- CCACHE_DIR

  ccache的目录，默认值是/var/tmp/ccache。

- CCACHE_SIZE

  ccacche的大小，默认值是2G。

- CFLAGS CXXFLAGS

  编译C和C++程序时的选项。例如

  ::

    CFLAGS="-O2 -march=i686 -pipe"
    CXXFLAGS="${CFLAGS}"

- CHOST

  编译软件时ebuild用 ``--host=${CHOST}`` 传递给configure的值。可参考以下文档：

  ::

    http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.1.1/gcc/Submodel-Options.html
    http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.3/gcc/Submodel-Options.html
    http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.2/gcc/Submodel-Options.html
    http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-2.95.3/gcc_2.html

.. - CLEAN_DELAY = integer
..     Determines how  long the countdown delay  will be after
..     running `emerge --unmerge`.
..     Defaults to 5 seconds.

.. - COLLISION_IGNORE   =  [space   delimited  list   of  fnmatch patterns]
..     This    variable   allows    the   user    to   disable
..     collision-protect   and   protect-owned  for   specific
..     fnmatch(3)   patterns.   For  backward   compatibility,
..     directories that  are listed without a  fnmatch pattern
..     will automatically have /* appended to them.
..     Defaults to "/lib/modules/* *.py[co]".

.. - CONFIG_PROTECT  =  [space  delimited list  of  files  and/or directories]
..     All files and/or directories that are defined here will
..     have "config file protection" enabled for them. See the
..     CONFIGURATION  FILES  section  of  emerge(1)  for  more
..     information.

.. - CONFIG_PROTECT_MASK = [space delimited  list of files and/or directories]
..     All files and/or directories that are defined here will
..     have "config  file protection"  disabled for  them. See
..     the CONFIGURATION  FILES section of emerge(1)  for more
..     information.

.. - CTARGET
..     This variable  is passed by  the ebuild scripts  to the
..     configure as --target=${CTARGET} only if it is defined.

.. - DISTDIR = [path]
..     Defines  the   location  of  your  local   source  file
..     repository.  After packages  are built,  it is  safe to
..     remove any and all files from this directory since they
..     will  be automatically  fetched on  demand for  a given
..     build. If you would  like to selectively prune obsolete
..     files  from  this  directory, see  eclean(1)  from  the
..     gentoolkit package.

..     Use the PORTAGE_RO_DISTDIRS variable  to specify one or
..     more read-only directories containing distfiles.

..     Note   that  locations   under  /usr/portage   are  not
..     necessarily  safe for  data storage.   See the  PORTDIR
..     documentation for more information.
..     Defaults to /usr/portage/distfiles.

.. - DOC_SYMLINKS_DIR
..     If this variable contains  a directory then symlinks to
..     html documentation will be installed into it.

.. - EBEEP_IGNORE
..     Defines  whether or  not to  ignore audible  beeps when
..     displaying  important   informational  messages.   This
..     variable is unset by default.

.. - EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS
..     Options to append  to the end of  the emerge(1) command
..     line on  every invocation.   These options will  not be
..     appended to  the command line  if --ignore-default-opts
..     is specified.

.. - EMERGE_LOG_DIR

..   emerge日志文件emerge.log和emerge-fetch.log的目录，默认值是/var/log。

.. - EMERGE_WARNING_DELAY = integer
..     Determines how  long the countdown delay  will be after
..     running `emerge --unmerge` for a system package.
..     Defaults to 10 seconds.

.. - EPAUSE_IGNORE
..     Defines  whether or  not  to ignore  short pauses  that
..     occur when displaying important informational messages.
..     This variable is unset by default.  If it is set to any
..     value pauses are ignored.

.. - EXTRA_ECONF = [configure options string]
..     Contains additional  options that econf will  append to
..     configure script arguments (see ebuild(5)).

.. - FEATURES = "sandbox"
..     Defines actions  portage takes  by default. This  is an
..     incremental variable.   Most of these settings  are for
..     developer use, but some are available to non-developers
..     as  well. The  sandbox  feature is  very important  and
..     should not be disabled by default.

..     assume-digests
..         When commiting work to cvs with repoman(1), assume
..         that  all existing   SRC_URI digests  are correct.
..         This  feature also  affects digest  generation via
..         ebuild(1) and emerge(1)  (emerge generates digests
..         only when the digest feature is enabled). Existing
..         digests for files that  do not exist in ${DISTDIR}
..         will   be   automatically    assumed   even   when
..         assume-digests is not enabled. If a file exists in
..         ${DISTDIR}  but  its  size   does  not  match  the
..         existing  digest, the  digest will  be regenerated
..         regardless  of whether  or  not assume-digests  is
..         enabled.  The  ebuild(1)   digest  command  has  a
..         --force  option   that  can   be  used   to  force
..         regeneration of digests.

..     binpkg-logs
..         Keep   logs   from   successful   binary   package
..         merges. This is relevant  only when PORT_LOGDIR is
..         set.

..     buildpkg
..         Binary packages  will be created for  all packages
..         that   are  merged.   Also  see   quickpkg(1)  and
..         emerge(1) --buildpkg and --buildpkgonly options.

..     buildsyspkg
..         Build  binary packages  for just  packages in  the
..         system set.

..     candy
..         Enable a special progress indicator when emerge(1)
..         is calculating dependencies.

..     ccache
..         Enable portage support for the ccache package.  If
..         the  ccache  dir is  not   present  in the  user's
..         environment,   then   portage  will   default   to
..         ${PORTAGE_TMPDIR}/ccache.

..         Warning: This  feature is known to  cause numerous
..         compilation   failures.   Sometimes   ccache  will
..         retain  stale  code  objects or  corrupted  files,
..         which  can   lead  to  packages  that   cannot  be
..         emerged. If  this happens  (if you  receive errors
..         like "File  not recognized: File  truncated"), try
..         recompiling the  application with  ccache disabled
..         before  reporting  a  bug. Unless  you  are  doing
..         development work, do not enable ccache.

..     clean-logs
..         Enable   automatic   execution  of   the   command
..         specified by  the PORT_LOGDIR_CLEAN  variable. The
..         default PORT_LOGDIR_CLEAN setting  will remove all
..         files from PORT_LOGDIR that  were last modified at
..         least 7 days ago.

..     collision-protect
..         A  QA-feature to  ensure  that  a package  doesn't
..         overwrite    files    it   doesn't    own.     The
..         COLLISION_IGNORE   variable   can   be   used   to
..         selectively  disable this  feature.  Also see  the
..         related protect-owned feature.

..     compress-build-logs
..         The causes  all build logs to  be compressed while
..         they are  being written.   Log file names  have an
..         extension that is  appropriate for the compression
..         type.  Currently,  only   gzip(1)  compression  is
..         supported,  so  build  logs   will  have  a  '.gz'
..         extension when this feature is enabled.

..     compressdebug
..         Compress  the debug  sections in  the split  debug
..         files with zlib to save space.  Make sure you have
..         built both binutils and  gdb with USE=zlib support
..         for  this to  work.   See  splitdebug for  general
..         split debug  information (upon which  this feature
..         depends).

..     compress-index
..         If set then a  compressed copy of 'Packages' index
..         file will  be written.   This feature  is intended
..         for Gentoo binhosts using certain webservers (such
..         as,  but not  limited to,  Nginx with  gzip_static
..         module) to avoid redundant on-the-fly compression.
..         The resulting file will be called

..     config-protect-if-modified
..         This  causes  the  CONFIG_PROTECT behavior  to  be
..         skipped  for files  that  have  not been  modified
..         since they were installed. This feature is enabled
..         by default.

..     digest
..         Autogenerate digests for packages when running the
..         emerge(1), ebuild(1),  or repoman(1)  commands. If
..         the  assume-digests feature  is also  enabled then
..         existing SRC_URI  digests will be  reused whenever
..         they are available.

..     distcc
..         Enable portage support for the distcc package.

..     distcc-pump
..         Enable portage support for the distcc package with
..         pump mode.

..     distlocks
..         Portage   uses  lockfiles   to  ensure   competing
..         instances don't  clobber each other's  files. This
..         feature  is  enabled  by  default  but  may  cause
..         heartache on  less intelligent  remote filesystems
..         like  NFSv2 and  some  strangely configured  Samba
..         server  (oplocks  off,   NFS  re-export).  A  tool
..         /usr/lib/portage/bin/clean_locks  exists  to  help
..         handle lock issues when a problem arises (normally
..         due to a crash or disconnect).

..     downgrade-backup
..         When a  package is downgraded to  a lower version,
..         call quickpkg(1)  in order  to create a  backup of
..         the installed version before  it is unmerged (if a
..         binary  package  of  the  same  version  does  not
..         already    exist).    Also   see    the    related
..         unmerge-backup feature.

..     ebuild-locks
..         Use locks to ensure that unsandboxed ebuild phases
..         never     execute    concurrently.     Also    see
..         parallel-install.

..     fakeroot
..         Enable fakeroot for the install and package phases
..         when a non-root user runs the ebuild(1) command.

..     fail-clean
..         Clean   up   temporary   files   after   a   build
..         failure. This  is particularly useful if  you have
..         PORTAGE_TMPDIR  on  tmpfs.   If  this  feature  is
..         enabled,   you  probably   also  want   to  enable
..         PORT_LOGDIR in order to  save the build log.  Both
..         the  ebuild(1)  command  and the  noclean  feature
..         cause the  fail-clean feature to  be automatically
..         disabled.

..     getbinpkg
..         Force emerges  to always  try to fetch  files from
..         the PORTAGE_BINHOST.   See  make.conf(5)  for more
..         information.

..     installsources
..         Install          source         code          into
..         /usr/src/debug/${CATEGORY}/${PF}     (also     see
..         splitdebug). This feature  works only if debugedit
..         is installed  and CFLAGS  is set to  include debug
..         information (such as with the -ggdb flag).

..     keeptemp
..         Do not  delete the ${T} directory  after the merge
..         process.

..     keepwork
..         Do not  delete the ${WORKDIR} directory  after the
..         merge process. ${WORKDIR} can then be reused since
..         this feature disables most of the clean phase that
..         runs prior  to each build.  Due to lack  of proper
..         cleanup,  this feature  can interfere  with normal
..         emerge operation  and therefore  it should  not be
..         left enabled for more than a short period of time.

..     fixlafiles
..         Modifies .la files to  not include other .la files
..         and some  other fixes (order of  flags, duplicated
..         entries, ...)

..     force-mirror
..         Only fetch files from configured mirrors, ignoring
..         SRC_URI, except  when mirror  is in  the ebuild(5)
..         RESTRICT variable.

..     force-prefix
..         Enable prefix support  for all ebuilds, regardless
..         of  EAPI, since  older  EAPIs  would otherwise  be
..         useless  with prefix  configurations. This  brings
..         compatibility with  the prefix branch  of portage,
..         which  also supports  EPREFIX for  all EAPIs  (for
..         obvious reasons).

..     lmirror
..         When mirror  is enabled  in FEATURES,  fetch files
..         even when mirror is also in the ebuild(5) RESTRICT
..         variable.   Do NOT  use lmirror  for clients  that
..         need  to override  RESTRICT when  fetching from  a
..         local  mirror, but  instead use  a "local"  mirror
..         setting in  /etc/portage/mirrors, as  described in
..         portage(5).

..     merge-sync
..         After  a  package  is  merged  or  unmerged,  sync
..         relevant files to disk in order to avoid data-loss
..         in the event of a  power failure.  This feature is
..         enabled by default.

..     metadata-transfer
..         Automatically  perform  a metadata  transfer  when
..         `emerge --sync`  is run.   In versions  of portage
..         >=2.1.5, this feature is disabled by default. When
..         metadata-transfer is disabled, metadata cache from
..         the  ${PORTDIR}/metadata/cache/ directory  will be
..         used  directly  (if  available)  and  eclasses  in
..         ${PORTDIR}/eclass/ must not  be modified except by
..         `emerge   --sync`  operations   since  the   cache
..         validation  mechanism  will not  recognize  eclass
..         modifications. Normally, this  issue only pertains
..         to users of the rsync tree since the cvs tree does
..         not contain a  metadata/cache/ directory. Users of
..         the rsync tree who  want to modify eclasses should
..         use  PORTDIR_OVERLAY   in  order  for   the  cache
..         validation mechanism to work correctly.

..     mirror
..         Fetch  everything  in  SRC_URI regardless  of  USE
..         settings, except do not fetch anything when mirror
..         is in RESTRICT.

..     multilib-strict
..         Many Makefiles assume  that their libraries should
..         go to /usr/lib,  or $(prefix)/lib. This assumption
..         can  cause  a serious  mess  if  /usr/lib isn't  a
..         symlink to  /usr/lib64. To find the  bad packages,
..         we     have    a     portage    feature     called
..         multilib-strict.  It  will   prevent  emerge  from
..         putting 64bit  libraries into anything  other than
..         (/usr)/lib64.

..     news Enable     GLEP    42     news    support.     See
..         http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/glep/glep-0042.html.

..     noauto
..         When  utilizing ebuild(1),  only run  the function
..         requested.

..     noclean
..         Do not  delete the the source  and temporary files
..         after the merge process.

..     nodoc
..         Do not install doc files (/usr/share/doc).

..     noinfo
..         Do not install info pages.

..     noman
..         Do not install manpages.

..     nostrip
..         Prevents the stripping of binaries that are merged
..         to the live filesystem.

..     notitles
..         Disables  xterm titlebar  updates (which  contains
..         status info).

..     parallel-fetch
..         Fetch in the background while compiling. Run `tail
..         -f  /var/log/emerge-fetch.log`  in a  terminal  to
..         view parallel-fetch progress.

..     parallel-install
..         Use finer-grained locks  when installing packages,
..         allowing   for    greater   parallelization.   For
..         additional parallelization, disable ebuild-locks.

..     prelink-checksums
..         If prelink(8) is installed then use it to undo any
..         prelinks on  files before computing  checksums for
..         merge and unmerge. This  feature is useful only if
..         prelink(8)  is  installed and  accurate  checksums
..         (despite  prelinking) are  needed for  some reason
..         such as  for checking  the integrity  of installed
..         files  or because  the unmerge-orphans  feature is
..         disabled.

..         Note that normal emerging  of packages from source
..         computes  the  checksums  before  things  will  be
..         prelinked, so  in such  cases, this  feature isn't
..         required either. Undoing  prelinking while merging
..         is only required when using tools like quickpkg(1)
..         which  can cause  already  prelinked  files to  be
..         merged.

..     preserve-libs
..         Preserve libraries when  the sonames change during
..         upgrade  or  downgrade.  Libraries  are  preserved
..         only if consumers of those libraries are detected.

..     protect-owned
..         This is identical to the collision-protect feature
..         except that  files may be overwritten  if they are
..         not  explicitly  listed  in   the  contents  of  a
..         currently installed package.  This is particularly
..         useful on  systems that have lots  of orphan files
..         that have  been left  behind by older  versions of
..         portage that  did not support  the unmerge-orphans
..         feature.      Like     collision-protect,      the
..         COLLISION_IGNORE   variable   can   be   used   to
..         selectively   disable   this    feature.   It   is
..         recommended  to  leave   either  protect-owned  or
..         collision-protect  enabled  at  all  times,  since
..         otherwise  file  collisions between  packages  may
..         result in  files being overwritten  or uninstalled
..         at inappropriate  times.  If  collision-protect is
..         enabled    then   it    takes   precedence    over
..         protect-owned.

..     python-trace
..         Output  a verbose  trace  of  python execution  to
..         stderr  when   a  command's   --debug   option  is
..         enabled.

..     sandbox
..         Enable  sandbox-ing  when  running  emerge(1)  and
..         ebuild(1).

..     sesandbox
..         Enable  SELinux sandbox-ing.   Do not  toggle this
..         FEATURE yourself.

..     sfperms
..         Stands for  Smart Filesystem  Permissions.  Before
..         merging   packages   to  the    live   filesystem,
..         automatically  search for  and set  permissions on
..         setuid  and  setgid files.  Files that  are setuid
..         have the group and  other read  bits removed while
..         files  that are  setgid  have the  other read  bit
..         removed.   See also suidctl below.

..     sign When commiting  work to cvs with  repoman(1), sign
..         the  Manifest with   a  GPG key.   Read about  the
..         PORTAGE_GPG_KEY variable in make.conf(5).

..     skiprocheck
..         Skip write access checks  on DISTDIR when fetching
..         files.  This  is   useful  when  FETCHCOMMAND  and
..         RESUMECOMMAND are  used to forward  fetch requests
..         to a  server that  exposes DISTDIR as  a read-only
..         NFS share.  A read-only DISTDIR is  not compatible
..         with the  distlocks, so it is  recommended to also
..         add  "-distlocks" to  FEATURES in  order to  avoid
..         warning  messages  that   are  triggered  by  this
..         incompatibility.

..     split-elog
..         Store  logs created  by PORTAGE_ELOG_SYSTEM="save"
..         in  category  subdirectories of  PORT_LOGDIR/elog,
..         instead of using PORT_LOGDIR/elog directly.

..     split-log
..         Store  build logs  in  category subdirectories  of
..         PORT_LOGDIR/build,  instead  of using  PORT_LOGDIR
..         directly.

..     splitdebug
..         Prior to stripping ELF etdyn and etexec files, the
..         debugging info is  stored for later use by various
..         debuggers.  This  feature is disabled  by nostrip.
..         You should also  consider setting compressdebug so
..         the  files don't  suck  up a  lot  of space.   For
..         installation of source code, see installsources.

..     strict
..         Have  portage react  strongly  to conditions  that
..         have the potential to  be  dangerous (like missing
..         or incorrect digests for ebuilds).

..     stricter
..         Have portage react strongly to conditions that may
..         conflict  with  system  security  provisions  (for
..         example textrels,  executable stack).   Read about
..         the QA_STRICT_* variables in make.conf(5).

..     suidctl
..         Before  merging packages  to the  live filesystem,
..         automatically  strip setuid   bits  from any  file
..         that is not listed in /etc/portage/suidctl.conf.

..     test Run  package-specific tests  during each  merge to
..         help  make sure   the  package compiled  properly.
..         See   test  in   ebuild(1)    and  src_test()   in
..         ebuild(5).  This feature  implies  the "test"  USE
..         flag if it is a  member of IUSE, either explicitly
..         or implicitly (see  ebuild(5) for more information
..         about  IUSE).    The  "test"  USE  flag   is  also
..         automatically disabled when  the "test" feature is
..         disabled.

..     test-fail-continue
..         If "test"  is enabled FEATURES and  the test phase
..         of  an  ebuild  fails,  continue  to  execute  the
..         remaining  phases  as  if   the  failure  had  not
..         occurred.  Note that the test phase for a specific
..         package may be disabled  by masking the "test" USE
..         flag in package.use.mask (see portage(5)).

..     unmerge-backup
..         Call  quickpkg(1)  to  create  a  backup  of  each
..         package before it is unmerged (if a binary package
..         of the same version does not already exist).  Also
..         see the related downgrade-backup feature.

..     unmerge-logs
..         Keep logs from successful  unmerge phases. This is
..         relevant only when PORT_LOGDIR is set.

..     unmerge-orphans
..         If a file is not claimed by another package in the
..         same   slot   and   it   is   not   protected   by
..         CONFIG_PROTECT,   unmerge    it   even    if   the
..         modification  time or  checksum  differs from  the
..         file that was originally installed.

..     unknown-features-filter
..         Filter out  any unknown  values that  the FEATURES
..         variable contains.

..     unknown-features-warn
..         Warn  if FEATURES  contains  one  or more  unknown
..         values.

..     userfetch
..         When portage  is run  as root, drop  privileges to
..         portage:portage  during  the fetching  of  package
..         sources.

..     userpriv
..         Allow portage to drop  root privileges and compile
..         packages  as   portage:portage without  a  sandbox
..         (unless usersandbox is also used).

..     usersandbox
..         Enable  the sandbox  in  the  compile phase,  when
..         running without root privs (userpriv).

..     usersync
..         Drop  privileges  to  the  owner  of  PORTDIR  for
..         emerge(1) --sync operations.

..     webrsync-gpg
..         Enable     GPG     verification     when     using
..         emerge-webrsync.

..     xattr
..         Preserve  extended  attributes  (filesystem-stored
..         metadata) when installing files (see attr(1)).

.. - FETCHCOMMAND
..     This variable  contains the  command used  for fetching
..     package sources from the internet.  It must contain the
..     full   path  to   the   executable  as   well  as   the
..     place-holders \${DISTDIR},  \${FILE} and  \${URI}.  The
..     command should be written to  place the fetched file at
..     \${DISTDIR}/\${FILE}.  Also see RESUMECOMMAND.

.. - FFLAGS FCFLAGS
..     Use these variables to set the desired optimization/CPU
..     instruction settings for  applications that you compile
..     with a  FORTRAN compiler.  FFLAGS is usually  passed to
..     the  FORTRAN 77  compiler, and  FCFLAGS to  any FORTRAN
..     compiler in more modern build systems.

..     For more  information, see the Invoking  GCC section of
..     the gcc manual:
..     http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/

.. - GENTOO_MIRRORS = [URIs]
..     Insert your space-separated list of local mirrors here.
..     These locations  are used to download  files before the
..     ones   listed   in    the   ebuild   scripts.   Merging
..     'mirrorselect' can help.  Entries in this variable that
..     have  no protocol  and  simply start  with  a '/'  path
..     separator  may be  used to  specify mounted  filesystem
..     mirrors.

.. - http_proxy ftp_proxy = [protocol://host:port]
..     These vars are  used if the sources  must be downloaded
..     from the  internet by wget(1).  They  are only required
..     if you use a proxy server for internet access.

.. - INSTALL_MASK = [space delimited list of file names]
..     Use this  variable if  you want to  selectively prevent
..     certain files  from being copied into  your file system
..     tree.   This does  not work  on symlinks,  but only  on
..     actual files.  Useful  if you wish to  filter out files
..     like  HACKING.gz  and   TODO.gz.  The  INSTALL_MASK  is
..     processed  just  before  a  package  is  merged.   Also
..     supported is  a PKG_INSTALL_MASK variable  that behaves
..     exactly like  INSTALL_MASK except that it  is processed
..     just before creation of a binary package.

.. - LDFLAGS
..     A list of flags to pass to the compiler when the linker
..     will be called.  See ld(1) for linker  flags, but don't
..     forget that these flags will  be passed directly to the
..     compiler. Thus, you must use  '-Wl' to escape the flags
..     which only the linker understands (see gcc(1)).

..     ***warning***
..     Setting this and other *FLAGS variables arbitrarily may
..     cause   compile  or   runtime  failures.   Bug  reports
..     submitted when nonstandard values are enabled for these
..     flags may be closed as INVALID.

.. - MAKEOPTS

..   进行并行编译的数量，建议值是 ``CPU数量+1`` 或者 ``CPU数量*2+1`` 。例如

..   ::

..     MAKEOPTS="-j3"

.. - NOCOLOR = ["true" | "false"]
..     Defines if color should be disabled by default.
..     Defaults to false.

.. - PKGDIR = [path]
..     Defines  the   location  where  created   .tbz2  binary
..     packages will  be stored when the  emerge(1) --buildpkg
..     option  is enabled.   By  default, a  given package  is
..     stored   in  a   subdirectory  corresponding   to  it's
..     category. However, for  backward compatibility with the
..     layout  used  by  older  versions of  portage,  if  the
..     ${PKGDIR}/All directory  exists then all  packages will
..     be stored  inside of  it and  symlinks to  the packages
..     will be  created in  the category  subdirectories. Note
..     that locations  under /usr/portage are  not necessarily
..     safe for  data storage.  See the  PORTDIR documentation
..     for more information.
..     Defaults to /usr/portage/packages.

.. - PORT_LOGDIR
..     This variable defines the directory in which per-ebuild
..     logs  are kept.   Logs are  created only  when this  is
..     set.         They         are         stored         as
..     ${CATEGORY}:${PF}:YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log in  the directory
..     specified. If the directory does  not exist, it will be
..     created  automatically and  group  permissions will  be
..     applied  to  it.   If  the  directory  already  exists,
..     portage will not modify it's permissions.

.. - PORT_LOGDIR_CLEAN
..     This variable  should contain a command  for portage to
..     call in order to  clean PORT_LOGDIR. The command string
..     should contain a \${PORT_LOGDIR} place-holder that will
..     be substituted  with the  value of that  variable. This
..     variable  will  have  no effect  unless  clean-logs  is
..     enabled in FEATURES.

.. - PORTAGE_BINHOST = [space delimited URI list]
..     This is  a list of  hosts from which portage  will grab
..     prebuilt-binary packages.  Each entry  in the list must
..     specify the full address  of a directory serving tbz2's
..     for  your   system  (this  directory  must   contain  a
..     'Packages' index file). This  is only used when running
..     with the  get binary pkg  options are given  to emerge.
..     Review emerge(1)  for more information.

.. - PORTAGE_BINHOST_HEADER_URI                                 =
..   "ftp://login:pass@grp.mirror.site/pub/grp/i686/athlon-xp/"
..     This variable  only makes sense  on a system  that will
..     serve as a binhost and  build packages for clients.  It
..     defines the URI header field for the package index file
..     which  is located  at ${PKGDIR}/Packages.  Clients that
..     have PORTAGE_BINHOST  properly configured will  be able
..     to fetch  the index and use  the URI header field  as a
..     base  URI  for fetching  binary  packages.  If the  URI
..     header field  is not defined  then the client  will use
..     it's ${PORTAGE_BINHOST} setting as the base URI.

.. - PORTAGE_BINPKG_TAR_OPTS
..     This variable contains options to  be passed to the tar
..     command for creation of binary packages.

.. - PORTAGE_BUNZIP2_COMMAND = [bunzip2 command string]
..     This variable should contain a command that is suitable
..     for portage to call for bunzip2 extraction operations.

.. - PORTAGE_BZIP2_COMMAND = [bzip2 command string]
..     This variable should contain a command that is suitable
..     for   portage    to   call   for    bzip2   compression
..     operations. PORTAGE_BZIP2_COMMAND  will also  be called
..     for extraction operation, with  -d appended, unless the
..     PORTAGE_BUNZIP2_COMMAND variable is set.

.. - PORTAGE_CHECKSUM_FILTER  =  [space  delimited list  of  hash names]
..     This variable may be used  to filter the hash functions
..     that  are  used  to  verify integrity  of  files.  Hash
..     function names  are case-insensitive, and the  * and -*
..     wildcard tokens are supported.
..     Defaults to the value of *.
..     Examples:
..     # Use all available hash functions
..     PORTAGE_CHECKSUM_FILTER="*"
..     # Use any function except whirlpool
..     PORTAGE_CHECKSUM_FILTER="* -whirlpool"
..     # Only use sha256
..     PORTAGE_CHECKSUM_FILTER="-* sha256"

.. - PORTAGE_COMPRESS = "bzip2"
..     This  variable contains  the command  used to  compress
..     documentation during the install phase.

.. - PORTAGE_COMPRESS_FLAGS = "-9"
..     This variable  contains flags for  the PORTAGE_COMPRESS
..     command.

.. - PORTAGE_FETCH_CHECKSUM_TRY_MIRRORS = 5
..     Number of mirrors to try  when a downloaded file has an
..     incorrect checksum.

.. - PORTAGE_FETCH_RESUME_MIN_SIZE = 350K
..     Minimum size  of existing file for  RESUMECOMMAND to be
..     called. Files  smaller than  this size will  be removed
..     and FETCHCOMMAND  will be  called to download  the file
..     from  the  beginning. This  is  useful  for helping  to
..     ensure that small garbage files  such as html 404 pages
..     are properly discarded. The  variable should contain an
..     integer number of  bytes and may have a  suffix such as
..     K, M, or G.

.. - PORTAGE_GPG_DIR
..     The gpg(1)  home directory  that is used  by repoman(1)
..     when sign is in FEATURES.
..     Defaults to $HOME/.gnupg.

.. - PORTAGE_GPG_KEY
..     The  gpg(1) key  used by  repoman(1) to  sign manifests
..     when sign is in FEATURES. In order to sign commits with

..     Defines  the   group  id  when  installing   files  via
..     dobin/dosbin.  Useful when running ebuild as yourself.
..     Defaults to 0.

.. - PORTAGE_INST_UID = [uid]
..     Defines  the   user  id   when  installing   files  via
..     dobin/dosbin.  Useful when running ebuild as yourself.
..     Defaults to 0.

.. - PORTAGE_IONICE_COMMAND = [ionice command string]
..     This variable  should contain a command  for portage to
..     call in order to adjust  the io priority of portage and
..     it's subprocesses. The command  string should contain a
..     \${PID} place-holder  that will be substituted  with an
..     integer pid.  For example, a  value of "ionice -c  3 -p
..     \${PID}"   will  set   idle  io   priority.  For   more
..     information about ionice,  see ionice(1). This variable
..     is unset by default.

.. - PORTAGE_NICENESS = [number]
..     The value of this variable will be added to the current
..     nice level that emerge is  running at.  In other words,
..     this will not set the nice level, it will increment it.
..     For  more information  about nice  levels and  what are
..     acceptable ranges, see nice(1).

.. - PORTAGE_RO_DISTDIRS = [space delimited list of directories]
..     When a given file does not exist in DISTDIR, search for
..     the file in  this list of directories.  Search order is
..     from   left   to   right.   Note   that   the   current
..     implementation  works  by  creating  a  symlink  inside
..     DISTDIR, but that may change in the future.

.. - PORTAGE_RSYNC_INITIAL_TIMEOUT = integer
..     Used  by emerge  --sync as  a timeout  for the  initial
..     connection to an rsync server.
..     Defaults to 15 seconds.

.. - PORTAGE_RSYNC_EXTRA_OPTS = [rsync options string]
..     Additional rsync options to be used by emerge --sync.
..     Defaults to no value.

.. - PORTAGE_RSYNC_OPTS = [rsync options string]
..     Default rsync options to be used by emerge --sync.
..     Don't change  this unless you know  exactly what you're
..     doing!
..     Defaults to  "--recursive --links  --safe-links --perms
..     --times   --compress   --force  --whole-file   --delete

.. - PORTAGE_RSYNC_RETRIES = [NUMBER]
..     The  number  of  times  rsync should  retry  on  failed
..     connections  before giving  up.  If set  to a  negative
..     number,  then retry  until all  possible addresses  are
..     exhausted.
..     Defaults to -1.

.. - PORTAGE_SYNC_STALE = [NUMBER]
..     Defines  the  number of  days  after  the last  `emerge
..     --sync` that  a warning  message should be  produced. A
..     value of 0 will disable warnings.
..     Defaults to 30.

.. - PORTAGE_TMPDIR = [path]
..     Defines   the   location   of   the   temporary   build
..     directories.
..     Defaults to /var/tmp.

..     This  should not  be set  to point  anywhere under  the
..     directory  tree specified  by PORTDIR  (/usr/portage by
..     default).

.. - PORTAGE_USERNAME = [user]
..     Defines  the   username  to   use  when   executing  in
..     userpriv/etc... modes (i.e.  non-root).

..     This  variable controls  permissions  for WORKDIR  (see
..     ebuild(5)).

.. - PORTDIR = [path]
..     Defines the location  of the Portage tree.  This is the
..     repository for  all profile information as  well as all
..     ebuilds.  If  you change  this,  you  must update  your
..     /etc/portage/make.profile symlink accordingly.
..     Defaults to /usr/portage.
..     ***Warning***
..     Data  stored  inside  PORTDIR  is  in  peril  of  being
..     overwritten   or   deleted   by   the   emerge   --sync
..     command. The  default value of  PORTAGE_RSYNC_OPTS will
..     protect the  default locations  of DISTDIR  and PKGDIR,
..     but users  are warned  that any other  locations inside
..     PORTDIR are not necessarily safe for data storage.  You
..     should not  put  other data (such as  overlays) in your
..     PORTDIR.  Portage  will walk  directory  structures and
..     may arbitrarily add invalid categories as packages.

.. - PORTDIR_OVERLAY = "[path] [different-path] [etc...]"
..     Defines the directories in  which user made ebuilds may
..     be stored  and not  overwriten when  `emerge --sync` is
..     run.  This is a space delimited list of  directories.
..     Defaults to no value.

.. - QA_STRICT_EXECSTACK = "set"
..     Set this  to cause  portage to ignore  any QA_EXECSTACK
..     override settings from ebuilds.  See also ebuild(5).

.. - QA_STRICT_WX_LOAD = "set"
..     Set  this to  cause  portage to  ignore any  QA_WX_LOAD
..     override settings from ebuilds.  See also ebuild(5).

.. - QA_STRICT_TEXTRELS = "set"
..     Set  this to  cause  portage to  ignore any  QA_TEXTREL
..     override settings from ebuilds.  See also ebuild(5).

.. - QA_STRICT_FLAGS_IGNORED = "set"
..     Set   this    to   cause   portage   to    ignore   any
..     QA_FLAGS_IGNORED override  settings from  ebuilds.  See
..     also ebuild(5).

.. - QA_STRICT_MULTILIB_PATHS = "set"
..     Set   this    to   cause   portage   to    ignore   any
..     QA_MULTILIB_PATHS override settings  from ebuilds.  See
..     also ebuild(5).

.. - QA_STRICT_PRESTRIPPED = "set"

..     FETCHCOMMAND, and must include any additional option(s)
..     that may be necessary in  order to continue a partially
..     downloaded file located at \${DISTDIR}/\${FILE}.

.. - ROOT = [path]
..     Use ROOT  to specify the  target root filesystem  to be
..     used for merging  packages  or ebuilds.  Typically, you
..     should set this setting  in the environment rather than
..     in   /etc/make.conf  itself.   It's commonly  used  for
..     creating  new  build   images.  Make sure  you  use  an
..     absolute path.  Refer to the  Cross-compilation section
..     of ebuild(5) for information about how dependencies are
..     handled for ROOT.
..     Defaults to /.

.. - RPMDIR = [path]
..     Defines the location where created RPM packages will be
..     stored.
..     Defaults to ${PORTDIR}/rpm.

.. - SYNC = [RSYNC]

..   运行命令 ``emerge --sync`` 所连接的服务器，默认值是 rsync://rsync.gentoo.org/gentoo-portage。

.. - UNINSTALL_IGNORE   =  [space   delimited  list   of  fnmatch patterns]
..     This  variable prevents  uninstallation  of files  that
..     match specific fnmatch(3) patterns.  In order to ignore
..     file collisions  with these files at  install time, the
..     same  patterns can  be  added  to the  COLLISION_IGNORE
..     variable.
..     Defaults to "/lib/modules/*".

.. - USE

..   USE设置，所有USE可用值见/usr/portage/profiles/use.desc。

.. - USE_ORDER = "env:pkg:conf:defaults:pkginternal:repo:env.d"
..     Determines the precedence of  layers in the incremental
..     stacking of the USE variable. Precedence decreases from
..     left  to  right  such   that  env  overrides  pkg,  pkg
..     overrides conf, and so forth.

..     ***warning***
..     Do not modify this value  unless you're a developer and
..     you  know what  you're doing.  If you  change this  and
..     something breaks, we will not help you fix it.
